# RESheeT

Create RESTful API from Google Sheet.

## What's this?

In prototypes, we usually need some simple DB and WEB API to CRUD the data.
While it is possible to provide real DBMS, isn't it great if we can simply use Google Sheet for storing the data?

Using Google Sheet has following benefits.

- Easy to create table. Just add a sheet and define header column. You are all ready.
- Easy to modify the data. Especially for a team mate who isn't familliar to DBMS.
- You can use formulars for advanced usecases.
